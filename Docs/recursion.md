# 4. **Recursion**

<h2>When to use it?</h2>

**Divide and conquer**:

- if problem can be broken down into smaller substrings.

**Tree-like structure**:

- each lebel of recursion can represent a level in the tree and the base cases represent the leaf node.

**Backtracking**:

- exploring multiple possibilities and potentially undoing choices made earlier.
