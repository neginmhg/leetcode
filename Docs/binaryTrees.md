# Explanation of Returning `-1` in Binary Tree Depth Calculation

In the context of calculating the depth of nodes in a binary tree, returning `-1` is a convention often used to represent the base case where a node is `None` (or `null` in other programming languages). This convention is crucial for accurately computing depths and path lengths within binary trees. Here's why `-1` is chosen:

## Depth Calculation in Binary Trees

1. **Base Case for Leaf Nodes**:

   - When a recursive function encounters a `None` node (typically checked with `if not root:`), it signifies the end of a path in the tree. Returning `-1` for this scenario indicates that there are no further edges beyond this node.

2. **Recursive Depth Calculation**:

   - The depth of a node in a binary tree is often defined as the maximum depth of its left and right subtrees, plus one (to account for the current node itself). This definition aligns with the common practice of counting edges in path calculations.

3. **Purpose of `-1`**:
   - By returning `-1` for `None` nodes, the function ensures that the depth computation accurately reflects the absence of any edges beyond the current node. This is par
   ```python
   if not root:
      depth= -1
   ```
