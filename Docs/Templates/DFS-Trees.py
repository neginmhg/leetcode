"""
How to Know How Many Returns You Need?

-- 1 return statement is typically enough in most DFS problems 
    because recursion naturally follows the "last-in, first-out" 
    principle, and you can propagate results upward 
    (i.e., from child to parent).


-- Multiple return statements are needed 
    when you need to make decisions or accumulate results based on child 
    nodes or conditions. For example, in a problem where you need to check 
    if a nodeâ€™s value satisfies certain conditions, or 
    if the subtree rooted at a node has a property 
    (like being balanced or a BST).
