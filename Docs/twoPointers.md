# 1. **Two Pointers Technique:**

- Using two pointers to solve a problem.
- These pointers typically start at different positions and move through the array or string in some way.
- Used to find subsequence or compare elements in an array
- Used to find pairs in sorted srray that sum uo to a target value.
- Good for Palindrome problem
- Purpose: comparison or findgin subsequence
- O(n) or O(n logn)
- Uses 2 pointers tht traverse the array or string often in different directions or convering towards each other.
- Two pointers are often used to find a certain subsequence or to solve problems where we need to compare elements in the array or string in a specific way.
- Examples of problems that can be solved using the two pointers technique include finding pairs in a sorted array that sum up to a target value or determining if a string is a palindrome.
