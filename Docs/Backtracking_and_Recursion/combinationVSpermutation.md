The concepts of permutation and combination are fundamental in combinatorics and have distinct differences:

### Permutation

1. **Definition**:
   - Permutation refers to the arrangement of items in a specific order.
2. **Order Matters**:
   - The order in which the items are arranged is important. Different orders of the same items are considered different permutations.
3. **Formula**:

   - The number of permutations of \( n \) items taken \( r \) at a time is given by:
     \[
     P(n, r) = \frac{n!}{(n-r)!}
     \]
   - Where \( n! \) (n factorial) is the product of all positive integers up to \( n \).

4. **Example**:
   - Set: {A, B, C}
   - Permutations of 2 items: AB, BA, AC, CA, BC, CB
   - There are \( P(3, 2) = \frac{3!}{(3-2)!} = \frac{6}{1} = 6 \) permutations.

### Combination

1. **Definition**:
   - Combination refers to the selection of items without regard to the order.
2. **Order Does Not Matter**:
   - The order in which the items are selected does not matter. Different orders of the same items are considered the same combination.
3. **Formula**:

   - The number of combinations of \( n \) items taken \( r \) at a time is given by:
     \[
     C(n, r) = \frac{n!}{r!(n-r)!}
     \]
   - This is also known as "n choose r."

4. **Example**:
   - Set: {A, B, C}
   - Combinations of 2 items: AB, AC, BC
   - There are \( C(3, 2) = \frac{3!}{2!(3-2)!} = \frac{6}{2 \times 1} = 3 \) combinations.

### Key Differences

1. **Order**:

   - Permutations consider order, while combinations do not.

2. **Quantity**:

   - The number of permutations is generally larger than the number of combinations for the same set and subset size because different orders of the same elements are counted multiple times in permutations.

3. **Use Cases**:
   - **Permutations**: Used when the order is important, such as in arrangements, sequences, and rankings.
   - **Combinations**: Used when the order is not important, such as in selecting items, groups, or teams.

### Summary Table

| Aspect                              | Permutation                       | Combination                         |
| ----------------------------------- | --------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| Order                               | Matters                           | Does not matter                     |
| Formula                             | \( P(n, r) = \frac{n!}{(n-r)!} \) | \( C(n, r) = \frac{n!}{r!(n-r)!} \) |
| Example (Set {A, B, C} for 2 items) | AB, BA, AC, CA, BC, CB            | AB, AC, BC                          |
| Use Case                            | Arrangements, sequences           | Selections, groups                  |

### Python Implementation

Hereâ€™s how you can generate permutations and combinations using Python's `itertools` library:

```python
import itertools

# Example set
elements = ['A', 'B', 'C']

# Generate all permutations of 2 items
perms = itertools.permutations(elements, 2)
print("Permutations of 2 items:")
for p in perms:
    print(p)

# Generate all combinations of 2 items
combs = itertools.combinations(elements, 2)
print("\nCombinations of 2 items:")
for c in combs:
    print(c)
```

This code will output all permutations and combinations of 2 items from the set {A, B, C}.

Usage of permutations and combinations across different types of problems:
