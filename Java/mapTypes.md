When choosing between `HashMap`, `TreeMap`, and `LinkedHashMap`, the main differences come down to **ordering** and **performance characteristics**.

Here's a breakdown of the three:

### 1. **`HashMap`**
   - **Implementation**: Based on a hash table.
   - **Ordering**: **Unordered**. The keys are stored in an order that depends on their hash values and the hash table's internal structure. There's no guarantee of the order in which the entries will be iterated.
   - **Performance**:
     - **Average Time Complexity for Basic Operations** (get, put, remove): O(1) for most cases (assuming good hash distribution).
   - **Use Case**: If you don't care about the order of the entries and you want the fastest performance for lookups, insertions, and deletions, use a `HashMap`.

   **Example**:
   ```java
   Map<String, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();
   map.put("apple", 5);
   map.put("banana", 3);
   ```

### 2. **`TreeMap`**
   - **Implementation**: Based on a red-black tree (a self-balancing binary search tree).
   - **Ordering**: **Sorted**. The entries are sorted according to the **natural ordering** of the keys (if the keys are `Comparable`), or by a custom comparator provided when constructing the `TreeMap`.
   - **Performance**:
     - **Average Time Complexity for Basic Operations** (get, put, remove): O(log n), since it has to maintain a sorted tree structure.
   - **Use Case**: If you need to maintain the keys in a sorted order, whether ascending or using a custom order, use a `TreeMap`.

   **Example**:
   ```java
   Map<String, Integer> map = new TreeMap<>();
   map.put("apple", 5);
   map.put("banana", 3);
   ```

   - **Resulting Order** (ascending order by default):
     ```
     {apple=5, banana=3}
     ```

### 3. **`LinkedHashMap`**
   - **Implementation**: Based on a hash table, but with a linked list to maintain the order of insertion (or access).
   - **Ordering**: **Insertion Order** (or access order if specified). The entries are iterated in the order in which they were inserted into the map. You can also create it with **access order** to maintain the order of entries based on their last access time.
   - **Performance**:
     - **Average Time Complexity for Basic Operations** (get, put, remove): O(1), similar to `HashMap`. The additional cost is due to maintaining the linked list for order, but it's still fast in practice.
   - **Use Case**: If you want to maintain the order of insertion or want a predictable iteration order, use `LinkedHashMap`.

   **Example**:
   ```java
   Map<String, Integer> map = new LinkedHashMap<>();
   map.put("apple", 5);
   map.put("banana", 3);
   ```

   - **Resulting Order** (insertion order):
     ```
     {apple=5, banana=3}
     ```

   - **With Access Order** (for example, for an LRU cache):
     ```java
     Map<String, Integer> map = new LinkedHashMap<>(16, 0.75f, true); // true for access order
     ```

### Key Differences in Summary:

| **Feature**           | **HashMap**              | **TreeMap**           | **LinkedHashMap**       |
|-----------------------|--------------------------|-----------------------|-------------------------|
| **Order**             | No order (unordered)     | Sorted (natural/comparator) | Insertion order (or access order) |
| **Time Complexity**   | O(1) for basic operations | O(log n) for basic operations | O(1) for basic operations |
| **Use Case**          | Fast lookups, insertions, and deletions without order | When you need sorted order of keys | When order (insertion or access) is important |
| **Underlying Structure** | Hash table              | Red-Black tree         | Hash table + linked list |

### Performance Summary:
- **`HashMap`** is the fastest when you don't need sorting or ordering and just want quick lookups.
- **`TreeMap`** is slower due to the tree structure but gives you sorted keys.
- **`LinkedHashMap`** maintains insertion order with slight overhead due to the linked list, but provides predictable iteration order.

### When to Use Each:
- **`HashMap`**: When you don't care about the order, and you want the fastest performance for key-based operations.
- **`TreeMap`**: When you need the keys to be automatically sorted in some order.
- **`LinkedHashMap`**: When you need to preserve the insertion order or use access order (for something like an LRU cache).

### Example Scenario for Each:
- **`HashMap`**: Caching where order doesn't matter.
- **`TreeMap`**: Storing data in a sorted map, such as a set of dates or any comparable objects.
- **`LinkedHashMap`**: Maintaining the order of insertion or access (for example, implementing an LRU cache).
