### 1. **What is the difference between object-oriented programming (OOP) and functional programming?**
- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** focuses on organizing code into classes and objects. It emphasizes the concepts of inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, and abstraction. OOP is typically used to model real-world entities.
- **Functional Programming (FP)**, on the other hand, treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing-state and mutable data. It emphasizes functions as first-class citizens and pure functions (functions that do not have side effects).

### 2. **Explain the concept of inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, and abstraction.**
- **Inheritance** allows a class to inherit methods and properties from another class, promoting code reusability.
- **Polymorphism** enables objects to be treated as instances of their parent class, but they can behave differently based on the subclass type. It is implemented using method overriding (runtime polymorphism) or method overloading (compile-time polymorphism).
- **Encapsulation** is the bundling of data and methods that operate on that data within a single unit (class), and restricting direct access to some of the object’s components, which improves data security and integrity.
- **Abstraction** is the concept of hiding the complex implementation details and showing only the necessary features of the object, simplifying the interaction with the system.

### 3. **What is a RESTful API, and how does it differ from a SOAP API?**
- A **RESTful API** (Representational State Transfer) is a lightweight, stateless web service that uses HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) and URIs to perform operations on resources. It is flexible, scalable, and commonly used in modern web services.
- A **SOAP API** (Simple Object Access Protocol) is a protocol that uses XML for message formatting and relies on application layer protocols like HTTP or SMTP. It is more rigid and requires strict communication standards, making it suitable for complex applications but less flexible compared to REST.

### 4. **What are the benefits and challenges of microservices architecture?**
- **Benefits**:
  - **Scalability**: Each microservice can be scaled independently based on demand.
  - **Flexibility**: Microservices can use different technologies and frameworks.
  - **Resilience**: Faults in one microservice do not affect others.
  - **Faster Deployment**: Teams can work on independent services and deploy them separately.
- **Challenges**:
  - **Complexity**: Managing a distributed system with many microservices can be complex.
  - **Data Consistency**: Ensuring data consistency across services can be difficult.
  - **Network Latency**: Communication between services can introduce network delays.

### 5. **How do you implement a binary search algorithm?**
Binary search works on sorted arrays and divides the search space in half at each step. Here’s the algorithm in Python:
```python
def binary_search(arr, target):
    left, right = 0, len(arr) - 1
    while left <= right:
        mid = (left + right) // 2
        if arr[mid] == target:
            return mid
        elif arr[mid] < target:
            left = mid + 1
        else:
            right = mid - 1
    return -1
```

### 6. **What is the difference between SQL and NoSQL databases?**
- **SQL databases** are relational, use structured query language (SQL) for managing data, and store data in tables with predefined schemas. Examples: MySQL, PostgreSQL.
- **NoSQL databases** are non-relational, store data in flexible, schema-less formats like key-value pairs, documents, or graphs. They are often used for big data and real-time web applications. Examples: MongoDB, Cassandra.

### 7. **What is the importance of data structures and algorithms in software development?**
- Data structures organize and store data efficiently, ensuring that operations (insertion, deletion, search) are performed optimally.
- Algorithms are step-by-step procedures to solve problems and help improve performance, especially for complex tasks like sorting, searching, and optimization.

### 8. **Explain the importance of hashing and its use cases.**
- **Hashing** is the process of mapping data to a fixed-size value using a hash function. It is important for fast data retrieval, such as in hash tables, caches, and data integrity checks (checksums).
- **Use cases**:
  - Storing passwords securely (hashing passwords before storing them).
  - Implementing hash maps to store key-value pairs.
  - Deduplication of data (hashing to detect duplicates).

### 9. **What are design patterns, and can you explain a few common ones like Singleton, Factory, and Observer?**
- **Design patterns** are proven solutions to common design problems in software development.
  - **Singleton**: Ensures a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access.
  - **Factory**: Creates objects without exposing the instantiation logic to the client.
  - **Observer**: Defines a one-to-many dependency between objects, so when one object changes state, all its dependents are notified and updated automatically.

### 10. **What is version control, and how does Git work?**
- **Version control** is a system that tracks changes to files over time. It enables collaboration, restores previous versions, and helps manage code history.
- **Git** is a distributed version control system where each user has a full copy of the repository. Key operations include:
  - **Clone**: Copy a remote repository to the local machine.
  - **Commit**: Record changes to the local repository.
  - **Push**: Upload changes to a remote repository.
  - **Pull**: Fetch changes from the remote repository.

### 11. **What is the difference between an abstract class and an interface?**
- An **abstract class** can have both abstract (without implementation) and concrete (with implementation) methods. It allows partial implementation and can have constructors.
- An **interface** only defines method signatures, and all methods are implicitly abstract. It cannot have method implementations or state (except static constants).

### 12. **Explain the concept of multi-threading and concurrency. How do you handle race conditions?**
- **Multi-threading** allows multiple threads to run in parallel, improving performance by utilizing multiple CPU cores.
- **Concurrency** is the ability to run multiple tasks at the same time, even if they are not executing simultaneously.
- **Race conditions** occur when two threads access shared data concurrently. To avoid race conditions:
  - Use **mutexes** or **locks** to ensure mutual exclusion.
  - Employ **atomic operations** or **synchronized blocks** in programming.

### 13. **What is a Deadlock, and how can you prevent it?**
- **Deadlock** occurs when two or more threads are blocked indefinitely, waiting for each other to release resources.
- To prevent deadlock:
  - **Avoid circular dependencies** in resource allocation.
  - Use **timeout** mechanisms or **try-locks**.
  - Apply a **lock hierarchy**, ensuring that locks are acquired in a consistent order.

### 14. **What are the SOLID principles in object-oriented design?**
- **S**: **Single Responsibility Principle** – A class should have only one reason to change.
- **O**: **Open/Closed Principle** – A class should be open for extension but closed for modification.
- **L**: **Liskov Substitution Principle** – Subtypes should be replaceable for their base types without affecting correctness.
- **I**: **Interface Segregation Principle** – Clients should not be forced to implement interfaces they don’t use.
- **D**: **Dependency Inversion Principle** – High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules, both should depend on abstractions.

### 15. **How does a load balancer work in a distributed system?**
A **load balancer** distributes incoming network traffic across multiple servers to ensure that no single server is overwhelmed. This improves the availability and reliability of applications. Types of load balancing:
- **Round-robin**: Distributes requests evenly.
- **Least connections**: Directs traffic to the server with the least active connections.
- **IP hash**: Routes traffic based on client IP addresses.

### 16. **Explain how garbage collection works in Java or Python.**
- **Garbage collection** automatically manages memory by reclaiming memory used by objects that are no longer needed.
  - In **Java**, the JVM uses garbage collectors (e.g., G1, Parallel, or CMS) that track and reclaim memory.
  - In **Python**, the garbage collector uses reference counting and cyclic garbage collection to manage memory.
