Part 1: Find a Scrambled Word in a String
Problem Explanation:

You are given a list of words and a "scrambled" string of letters.
The task is to determine if any word from the list can be formed using the letters in the scrambled string.
The letters in the scrambled string can appear in any order, and you can use each letter at most once.
If a word from the list can be formed, return it. Otherwise, return None.
Example:

Input: words = ["cat", "baby", "dog"], scrambled = "tcabnihjs"
Explanation: The word "cat" can be formed using the letters t, c, and a from the scrambled string.
Output: "cat"

--------------------------------------------
"""
# Need t check if all char of word exists in scrambled string
#without repeating chars so use HashMap
#Frequency counter hashmap

class Solution:
    def containsWord(self,words:List[str], scrambledStr:str)->str:
        #String to hashmap frequency

        for word in words:
            wordCounter= Counter(word)
            ## Use subtraction of Counters to check if the word can be formed
            if not (wordCounter-scrambledCounter):  #When you subtract one Counter object from another, the result is a new Counter object that contains only the positive differences in counts.
                return word
            
        return ""
#Time : O(k.m)  k is #of words, m is average length of words
#Space: O(n+m)  n is length of scrambled str, m is length of current word being checked

Part 2: Find a Word in a 2D Grid
Problem Explanation:

You are given a 2D grid of letters and a target word.
The word may appear in the grid either:
Horizontally to the right, or
Vertically downward.
The letters must be consecutive but donâ€™t need to wrap or change direction.
The task is to return the coordinates of the letters in the grid that form the word.
If there are multiple matches, return any one.
[['c', 'c', 'x', 't', 'i', 'b'],
 ['c', 'c', 'a', 't', 'n', 'i'],
 ['a', 'c', 'n', 'n', 't', 't'],
 ['t', 'c', 's', 'i', 'p', 't'],
 ['a', 'o', 'o', 'o', 'a', 'a']]

 Word: "catnip"

Explanation: Starting from (1, 1), the word "catnip" is found by moving:
Right: (1, 1) -> (1, 2) -> (1, 3)
Down: (1, 3) -> (2, 3) -> (3, 3) -> (3, 4)
Output: [(1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 3), (3, 3), (3, 4)]

Part 3: Find Multiple Words in a 2D Grid
Problem Explanation:

This is an extension of Part 2.
You are given a grid and a list of words. The goal is to find the coordinates of all words in the grid.
Each letter in the grid can only be used once across all words.
If multiple matches are possible for a word, return any valid one.
Example:

Grid:
[['b', 'a', 'b'],
 ['y', 't', 'a'],
 ['x', 'x', 't']]

 Words: ["by", "bat"]

Explanation:
Word "by" can be formed as:
(0, 0) -> (1, 0) (Down)
Word "bat" can be formed as:
(0, 2) -> (1, 2) -> (2, 2) (Down)
Output: [(0, 0), (1, 0)] for "by" and [(0, 2), (1, 2), (2, 2)] for "bat".
