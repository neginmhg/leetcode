Description

There is a foreign language which uses the latin alphabet, but the order among letters is not "a", "b", "c" ... "z" as in English.

You receive a list of non-empty strings words from the dictionary, where the words are sorted lexicographically based on the rules of this new language.

Derive the order of letters in this language. If the order is invalid, return an empty string. If there are multiple valid order of letters, return any of them.

A string a is lexicographically smaller than a string b if either of the following is true:

The first letter where they differ is smaller in a than in b.
There is no index i such that a[i] != b[i] and a.length < b.length.
Example 1:
Input: ["z","o"]

Output: "zo"
Explanation:
From "z" and "o", we know 'z' < 'o', so return "zo".

Example 2:

Input: ["hrn","hrf","er","enn","rfnn"]

Output: "hernf"
Explanation:

from "hrn" and "hrf", we know 'n' < 'f'
from "hrf" and "er", we know 'h' < 'e'
from "er" and "enn", we know get 'r' < 'n'
from "enn" and "rfnn" we know 'e'<'r'
so one possibile solution is "hernf"
Constraints:

The input words will contain characters only from lowercase 'a' to 'z'.
1 <= words.length <= 100
1 <= words[i].length <= 100

Time Complexity: (O(C)), where (C) is the total number of characters in all words.  
    time complexity for the topological sort is O(E+V) where 
        V is the number of vertices (unique characters) and 
        E is the number of edges

Space Complexity: (O(U + P)), where (U) is the number of unique characters and 
(P) is the number of character dependencies (edges).  Indegree dictionary has U and 
for Adjacency list we have U+P ; U is unique characters and up to P dependencies/edges.
Queue and Result array each take O (U) for space.
